iddis.io
=======

This project is current developed by Roosevelt dos Santos JÃºnior, dedicate to build the best possible solution to the development Windows Desktop/Mobile/Web applications that use [Redis.IO](http://www.redis.io).

**iddis.io** is a class library, that allow the developers build applications that communicate with Redis.IO. iddis.io is builded forged with the following principles:
  * Provide to the developers the full set of Redis.IO supported commands
  * Use the appropriate string-handling methods of the .NET Framework, to get the best possible performance
  * Not perform number to string data type conversions, quickly and with low memory consumption

This is a first step for the iddis.io project and there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. So please check 
out the roadmap to see where the project is headed or participate by contributing along the way.

Contribute
==========

There are many ways to contribute to the project.
You can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features 
as they are implemented, submitting bugs and helping me verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submitting code 
fixes or code contributions of your own.

Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by me, and only those that meet an extremely high 
bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

Roadmap
=======

The source code on this repo is under active development that will be part of my next release. For details on my planned features and future direction, please refer to my roadmap.
